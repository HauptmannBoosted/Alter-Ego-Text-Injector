# Alter-Ego-Text-Injector (Godot Project)
quick and dirty tool to insert text into the Alter/Ego real-time singing synthesizer VST plugin presets


This is a tool made to inject text from a textfield directly into Alter/Ego preset files.

It works by replacing one line in the saved preset, which holds user entered text.

In order to use it, use the file browser (or update the path variable directly in code) to point at the target preset file, type the desired text in the text editor and press the push-to-preset-button.
Incase you experience difficulties, try to use an unchanged preset (just by opening alter/ego, and saving the default settings to a preset).


Was I 100% sure, that there was no way to bulk-insert text into alter/ego? No. Does it matter now? No.
